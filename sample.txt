# Lines that start with "#" are comments.
# Each line maps a pattern to one or more owners.

# Syntax for specifying a single user or team as an owner:
# <pattern> <username or team>

# Example: A single owner for a specific path
/docs/* @username

# Syntax for specifying multiple owners:
# <pattern> <username or team> <username or team>

# Example: Multiple owners for a specific path
/src/* @user1 @teamA

# Patterns can use glob syntax:
# * matches any sequence of characters (except '/')
# ? matches any single character
# ** matches directories recursively

# Example: Owners for all JavaScript files
*.js @user2

# Example: Owners for all files in the 'config' directory and its subdirectories
/config/** @teamB

# You can also use email addresses to specify owners:
# <pattern> <email>

# Example: Owner specified by email
/assets/logo.png user@example.com
